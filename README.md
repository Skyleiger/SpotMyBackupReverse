# SpotMyBackupReverse

A little playlist reverser for the useful [SpotMyBackup](http://www.spotmybackup.com) tool.

SpotMyBackup is a nice tool to import and export your [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com) playlists from one account to another.
The only problem is that it imports the tracks in the wrong direction, so
that the newest tracks are at the top of the playlist, which is not similar to Spotify.
This tool fixes this and reorders the tracks in the backup file.

Simply use SpotMyBackupReverse by running the following at the command line:
`java -jar SpotMyBackupReverse.jar <file>`
The file attribute should be replaced with your backup json file.
